# S2F (Sequence to Function)

A protein function prediction tool that takes only the sequences as input

## About S2F

S2F brings the power of label propagation in biological networks for prediciting protein function for newly sequenced organisms. You can read more about S2F in the project's [website](https://paccanarolab.org/s2f).
